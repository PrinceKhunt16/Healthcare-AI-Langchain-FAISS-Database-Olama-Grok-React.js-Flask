      "Both headaches and migraines can be painful and disruptive, but they have some key differences. \n\n**Headaches** are generally described as pain in the head that can range from mild to severe. They can be caused by various factors like stress, muscle tension, or even dehydration. Most headaches go away on their own or with over-the-counter pain relievers. \n\n**Migraines** are a type of headache, but they are often much more intense and debilitating. Migraines typically involve a throbbing or pulsing pain, often on one side of the head.  They can also be accompanied by other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. \n\n**Here's a simple way to think about it:** \n\nImagine a headache like everyday traffic noise - annoying but manageable. \n\nNow, picture a migraine as a jackhammer pounding right next to your head - intense, overwhelming, and difficult to ignore. \n\n**Important Note:** This is a simplified explanation. If you're experiencing frequent or severe headaches, it's crucial to consult a doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment.  They can determine the underlying cause and recommend the most effective management plan for you. ðŸ˜Š \n",
